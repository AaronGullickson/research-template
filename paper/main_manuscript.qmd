# default formats. I use a custom aog-article-pdf available as an extension, but
# this can be replaced with the default pdf format. The submittable extenstion
# also gives me submittable-pdf and submittable-docx for journal submission
# entries, but those are commented out until I need them.
format:
  aog-article-pdf:
    keep-tex: false
    fig-width: 7.5 # set to the (full width - margins) of letter   
  submittable-pdf:
    keep-tex: false
    fig-pos: "!t"
  submittable-docx:
    fig-format: pdf   # for sharper images
    # figure sizing is a pain in docx, but this works pretty well. Theoretically
    # with 1 inch margins on 8.5 by 11 we should have 6.5 inches for width but
    # there is other word junk there.
