# data_version.yml
#
# This file can be used to track data version for projects where data 
# will be accessed from external sources, such as Google Drive. In such
# cases, the organize_data.qmd can be used to download the data to each 
# collaborator's local machine. However, to avoid re-downloading the data, 
# each collaborator can be made to track which version of the data they
# have and this version can be checked against the "official" version here
# which will indicate whether they need to re-download the data. See the 
# example code chunk in analysis/organize_data.qmd for how it can be used.

# any consistent string will work for version (e.g. date, v1, v2, uuid)
