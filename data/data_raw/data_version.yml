# data_version.yml
#
# This file can be used to track data version for projects where data 
# will be accessed from external sources, such as Google Drive. In such
# cases, the organize_data.qmd can be used to download the data to each 
# collaborator's local machine. However, to avoid re-downloading the data, 
# each collaborator can be made to track which version of the data they
# have with something like after downloading data:
# 
# write_yaml(list(version = repo_version), here("data", "data_raw", "data_version_local.yml"))
# 
# where repo_version is the version listed here. Whenever the organize_data
# script is re-run, it should then check version here against version in 
# data_version_local.yml and only re-download data when they are different.
# 
# Whenever the underlying data change and a re-download is necessary for all
# collaborators, just change the version value below and commit and push the 
# change.
