<!-- This file can be used to create a website of all of the desired 
     quarto docs from the _docs directory. To do that:
     
       1. adjust the table below to include or exxclue any desired products. 
          All products committed and pushed will still be available on the 
          website, but you will have to know the URL, so the table provides 
          convenient links.
       2. Uncomment out the index.qmd rendering line in _quarto.yml and render
          this document (or build the whole project).
       3. Remove the .gitignore on the _docs directory and commit
          and push desired files there to GitHub.
       4. Set up a netlify website that links to the _docs directory 
          of this repo. You are done!
      
      You an also set this up to work with GitHub Pages, but unless you 
      have a paid account, it will only work for public repositories. If
      you decide to go this route, it might make sense to rename the output 
      directory from _docs to docs and set GH-pages to treat that as the root
      directory, for ease of use. 
      
      You can also add more information here about your project just like you
      would for any quarto document.
